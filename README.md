# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
PyBer, a ride-sharing app company seeks to improve access to rideshare services in underserved communities. Pyber understand s that service consumption is directly correlated to affordability.

In this project, we will analyze Pyber rideshare data gathered between January to May 2019. To help Pyber understand the rideshare data we will utilize Jupyter notebook along with python modules Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to transform data sets and Mathplotlip to create visualizations that will aid Pybe in understanding the following by their respective city types of Urban, Rural, & Suburban: 

- Total number of rides
- Total number of drivers
- Total fares 
- Average fare per ride
- Average fare per drive

## Results:
 
Urban city types have the greatest amount of total drivers accounting for 81% of total drives with a total of 2405 compared to Surbaban with 490 and Rural cities with 78 total drivers. The Average fare per drive is lower in urban cities. When comparing Sunburn cities to urban cities, urban cities' average fare per drive is 50% less than the average fare per drive.

## Summary:  

Urban Cities accounted for the Largest  Number of Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares and the lowest Average Fare Peer Ride:  Urban Average Fare Peer Ride. 

Based on the results, the best options to addressing disparities among the city types include increasing availabilities of total drivers which in turn would increase rideshare access and reduce cost resulting in an increase of access and affordability to the rideshare service within Rural & Suburban cities.
